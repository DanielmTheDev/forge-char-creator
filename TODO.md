# forge-content TODO

Simple running list. Check off as done. See CLAUDE.md for full spec.

## Now — Option 2: one-ability spike (bottom-up, scaffold after)
- [x] A0. Author ONE ability as JSON by hand. (Bracers of Defense, +2 AC passive — /tmp/fc-spike/src)
- [x] A1. Compile standalone via foundryvtt-cli into LevelDB pack. Round-trip verified. FINDING: docs need `_key` field (`!items!<id>`, effects `!items.effects!<itemId>.<effectId>`) or CLI silently skips them → A3 scaffold should auto-inject `_key` from `_id`.
- [x] A2. Proved in real Foundry via throwaway probe: doc loads (T1) + passive effect applies (AC +2, T2). Probe deleted. NOTE: playwright 1.60.0 bump required `npx playwright install chromium` once.
- [x] A3. forge-content scaffold built: module.json, src/packs/forge-abilities/, build-packs.mjs (auto-injects `_key`), unpack-packs.mjs (strips `_key`), npm content:pack/unpack, README. Compiled packs/ gitignored. FINDINGS: CLI `pack --in` reads dir directly but `unpack --in` reads <dir>/<name> (asymmetric); `unpack` renames files to `<Name>_<id>.json` so it's import-only, not for round-tripping authored source.
- [ ] A4. Migrate existing forge-char-creator packs → JSON source (use content:unpack pattern); gitignore those `packs/`; regen via pack. (kills binary churn + junk docs)
- [ ] A2-redo. Re-prove the compiled forge-content pack loads via a registered module install (probe used Item.create, not a real compendium load). Quick.

## Roadmap (after A)
- [ ] B. Functional test gate (T0-T3) wired into test.sh; nothing publishes until green. ← NEXT
- [x] C. Publish automation DONE: release.yml builds forge-content packs in CI, zips, uploads forge-content.zip to rolling `latest` release. Manifest + download verified HTTP 200. PENDING: B should gate publish (currently every push to main publishes, even unverified).
- [ ] D. Image → statblock (vision → JSON → pipeline A). Last, highest risk.

## Bugs found (fix later, tracked)
- [ ] **Pack test residue**: 6 `Overtime_Poison_E2E_*` junk docs committed in forge-features pack. E2E tests write into the real pack → source of git churn. Fix: tests use throwaway/temp pack or clean up after. (found 2026-06-01)
- [ ] **`[object Object]` description**: Fire_Aura effect `description` serialized to literal `"[object Object]"`. Serialization bug in authoring path. (found 2026-06-01)

## Decisions log
- 2026-06-01: New `forge-content` module, same repo. JSON source → foundryvtt-cli compile → LevelDB packs. Stop committing binary .ldb diffs.
